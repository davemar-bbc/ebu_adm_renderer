Developer Documentation
=======================

These pages contain documentation for people wanting to use the EAR python APIs
to work with ADM data.

The EAR was primarily developed as a stand-alone application for rendering ADM
files to loudspeaker signals, to support the standardisation of renderers. As
such, the internal APIs are not necessarily as tidy and stable as they could
be, as they were not the focus during development. You have been warned!

That being said, they represent one of the more complete packages for working
with ADM data (along with libbw64_ and libadm_), so we welcome changes that
improve the experience of using them.
