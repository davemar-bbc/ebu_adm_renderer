EBU ADM Renderer (EAR) Documentation
====================================

The **EBU ADM Renderer** **(EAR)** is a complete interpretation of the **Audio
Definition Model (ADM)** format, specified in Recommendation `ITU-R BS.2076-1
<https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BS.2076/en>`__. ADM is the recommended format
for all stages and use cases within the scope of programme productions of
**Next Generation Audio (NGA)**.

This documentation applies to the python reference implementation of the EAR,
which can be found at https://github.com/ebu/ebu_adm_renderer.

This EAR is capable of rendering audio signals to all reproduction systems
mentioned in `“Advanced sound system for programme production (ITU-R
BS.2051-1)” <https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BS.2051/en>`__.

Further descriptions of the EAR algorithms and functionalities can be found
in `EBU Tech 3388
<https://tech.ebu.ch/publications/adm-renderer-for-use-in-nga-broadcasting>`__.

From version 2.0, this is also the reference implementation of `ITU-R BS.2127
(ITU ADM Renderer) <https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BS.2127/en>`__.
